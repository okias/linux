Sub-device configuration models
===============================

The V4L2 specification defines a subdev API that exposes three type of
configuration elements: formats, selection rectangles and controls. The
specification contains generic information about how those configuration
elements behave, but not precisely how they apply to particular hardware
features. We leave some leeway to drivers to decide how to map selection
rectangles to device features, as long as they comply with the V4L2
specification. This is needed as hardware features differ between devices, so
it's the driver's responsibility to handle this mapping.

Unfortunately, this lack of clearly defined mapping in the specification has led
to different drivers mapping the same hardware features to different API
elements, or implementing the API elements with slightly different
behaviours. Furthermore, many drivers have implemented selection rectangles in
ways that do not comply with the V4L2 specification. All of this makes userspace
development difficult.

Sub-device configuration models specify in detail what the user space can expect
from a sub-device in terms of V4L2 sub-device interface support, semantics
included.

A sub-device may implement more than one configuration model at the same
time. The implemented configuration models can be obtained from the sub-device's
``V4L2_CID_CONFIG_MODEL`` control.

Common raw camera sensor model
------------------------------

The common raw camera sensor model defines a set of enumeration and
configuration interfaces (formats, selections etc.) that cover the vast majority
of functionality of raw camera sensors. Not all of the interfaces are
necessarily offered by all drivers.

A sub-device complies with the common raw sensor model if the
``V4L2_CONFIG_MODEL_COMMON_RAW_SENSOR`` bit is set in the
``V4L2_CID_CONFIG_MODEL`` control of the sub-device.

The common raw camera sensor model is aligned with
:ref:`media_using_camera_sensor_drivers`. Please refer to that regarding aspects
not specified here.

Each camera sensor implementing the common raw sensor model exposes a single
V4L2 sub-device. The sub-device contains a single source pad (0) and two or more
internal pads: one or more image data internal pads (starting from 1) and
optionally an embedded data pad.

Additionally, further internal pads may be supported for other features. Using
more than one image data internal pad or more than one non-image data pad
requires these pads documented separately for the given device. The indices of
the image data internal pads shall be lower than those of the non-image data
pads.

This is shown in :ref:`media_subdev_config_model_common_raw_sensor_subdev`.

Routes
^^^^^^

A sub-device conforming to common raw camera sensor model implements the
following routes.

      - Source pad/stream

Support for the embedded data stream is optional. Drivers supporting the
embedded data stream may allow disabling and enabling the route.

Sensor pixel array size, cropping and binning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sensor's pixel array is divided into one or more areas. The areas around the
the visible pixel area in the pixel array, usually one or more sides, may
contain optical black pixels, dummy pixels and other non-image pixels. The full
size of the pixel array that may be captured is conveyed by the format on (pad,
stream) pair 1/0.

A rectangle within the pixel array contains the visible pixels. Capturing the
non-visible pixels outside the visible pixel area may be supported by the
sensor. The visible pixel area corresponds to the ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP_DEFAULT``
selection target on (pad, stream) pair 1/0.

Sensors can perform multiple operations that affect the output image size. The first
of these is the analogue crop. Analogue crop limits the area of the pixel array
which the sensor will read, affecting sensor timing as well. The granularity of
the analogue crop configuration varies greatly across sensors: some sensors
support only a few different analogue crop configurations whereas others may
support anything divisible by a given number of pixels. The analogue crop
configuration corresponds to the ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP`` selection target on (pad,
stream) pair 1/0. The default analogue crop rectangle corresponds to the visible
pixel area.

In the next step, binning is performed on the image data read from camera
sensor's pixel array, as determined by the analogue crop configuration. Enabling
binning will effectively result in an image smaller than the original by given
binning factors horizontally and vertically. Typical values are 1/2 and 1/3 but
others may well be supported by the hardware as well.

Sub-sampling follows binning. Sub-sampling, like binning, reduces the size of
the image by including only a subset of samples read from the sensor's pixel
matrix, typically every n'th pixel horizontally and vertically, taking the
sensor's color pattern into account. Sub-sampling is generally configurable
separately horizontally and vertically.

The combined effect of binning and sub-sampling is configured using the
``V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE`` rectangle, relative to the analogue crop rectangle, on
(pad, stream) pair 1/0. The driver implementation determines how to configure
binning and sub-sampling to achieve the desired size.

The digital crop operation takes place after binning and sub-sampling. It is
configured by setting the ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP`` rectangle on (pad, stream) pair
0/0.

The scaling operation is performed after the digital crop. It is configured by
setting the ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE`` rectangle on (pad, stream) pair 0/0,
relative to the digital crop. The resulting image size is further output by the
sensor on the sensor's data interface.

The sensor's output mbus code is configured by setting the format on the (pad,
stream) pair 0/0. The width and height fields are used to configure post-scaler
digital crop if supported by the driver, affecting the right and bottom edges of
the frame. If post-scaler digital crop is not supported, the width and height
fields of the format will match the compose rectangle sizes applied on the same
0/0 (pad, stream) pair.

Drivers may only support some or even none of these configurations, in which
case they do not expose the corresponding selection rectangles. If any selection
targets are omitted, the further selection rectangle or format is instead
related to the previous implemented selection rectangle. For instance, if the
sensor supports binning but not analogue crop, then the binning configuration
(``V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE`` selection target) is done in relation to the visible
pixel area (``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP_DEFAULT`` selection target).

Embedded data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The embedded data stream is produced by the sensor when the corresponding route
is enabled. The embedded data route may also be immutable or not exist at all,
in case the sensor (or the driver) does not support it.

Generally the sensor embedded data width is determined by the width of the image
data whereas the number of lines are constant for the embedded data. The user
space may obtain the size of the embedded data once the image data size on the
source pad has been configured.
